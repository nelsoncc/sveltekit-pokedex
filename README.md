# Description

My first sveltekit application that uses the Pokemon API to build a Pokedex!

# Developing

Once you've cloned this project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

# TODO list
## Features
- Night mode
- Toggle for HD images
- Scroll infinite loading
- Filter by type (fire, water, ...)

## Technical Debt
- Cypress tests
- Storybook
